# DesiBiteHub
Project that helps connect Street Food sellers and Vendors
# DesiBiteHub" = A central platform where authentic Indian street food (bites) and vendors connect."

## Project Description
DesiBiteHub is an intelligent, AI-powered platform designed to bridge the gap between street food vendors and food lovers in a culturally rich and tech-driven way. In an era where convenience, visibility, and digital engagement define consumer choices, DesiBiteHub revolutionizes the way people discover, experience, and support local street food vendors.

Our platform celebrates the vibrancy of desi street food culture by connecting small-scale vendors to a wider audience through smart location mapping, real-time stall updates, and personalised food recommendations powered by AI. From tracking your favourite chaat wala to finding the nearest hygienic thela, DesiBiteHub enhances the accessibility and visibility of local food gems while digitally empowering vendors.

With features like AI-based stall discovery, digital menus, customer feedback integration, QR-based payment support, vendor analytics, and raw material sourcing through community bidding, DesiBiteHub supports both customers and vendors in creating a seamless and flavourful street food experience. Whether youâ€™re a foodie hunting for your next spicy bite or a vendor aiming to grow your reach, DesiBiteHub is your go-to platform for exploring Indiaâ€™s bustling food streets â€“ one bite at a time.



## Why DesiBiteHub?
- **Supply Chain Gap**:  Street food vendors struggle to access affordable, quality raw materials consistently
- **Lack of Vendor Networks**:  Individual sellers lack a central platform to connect with trusted suppliers in their locality
- **Unstable Pricing**: Vendors face fluctuating market rates without collective bargaining power or price transparency
- **Language Accessibility**: Many financial tools lack support for Indian languages, limiting accessibility
- **Decision Support**: Users need contextual guidance for making better financial choices
- **Community Isolation**:  Street food sellers operate independently with minimal collaboration or support from peer communities
